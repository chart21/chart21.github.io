I am a Software Engineer working on Autonomous Driving at the BMW Group and a Researcher at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

My research focuses on Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) using MPC. I am generally interested in autonomous driving, cryptography, and distributed systems.

Prior to my reserach on MPC and PPML, I worked in Research and Development positions at BMW Group, Huawei, and the University of Sydney. I received my Masterâ€™s with distinction from the Informatics faculty of the Technical University of Munich.

I have multiple years of experience programming in C++ and Python. In 2018 and 2019, my team and I won first place in the annual Google Munich Hackathon.

Check out my recent publications on [High-Throughput Secure Multiparty Computation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/386.pdf) and [PIGEON: Private Inference of Neural Networks](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1371.pdf) published at [PETS 2025](https://petsymposium.org/2025/).
