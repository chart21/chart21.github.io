I am a third-year Computer Science student at the Technical University of Munich and the BMW Group.

My research focuses on Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning using MPC. I am generally interested in cryptography, privacy, and distributed systems.

Before my PhD, I worked in Research and Development positions at BMW Group, Huawei, and the University of Sydney. I received my Masterâ€™s with distinction from the Informatics faculty of the Technical University of Munich.

I have multiple years of experience programming in C++ and Python. In 2018 and 2019, my team and I won first place in the annual Google Munich Hackathon.

Check out my latest publication on novel high-throughput MPC protocols [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03776).
